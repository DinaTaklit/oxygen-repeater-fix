# Oxygen Repeater Fix (Duplicated IDs)

This plugin fix duplicated IDs generated by [Oxygen Repeater](https://oxygenbuilder.com/documentation/builder-elements/repeater/) element.

This plugin doesn't modify any of Oxygen functionality. It just modify the output, the HTML and CSS code, using simple preg_replace.

**HTML mod**

- modify `oxy_dynamic_list` shortcode output, move defined ID to class
- store `oxy_dynamic_list` children IDs for CSS modification

**CSS mod**

- monitor CSS xlink request, and buffer the output
- for cached CSS, modify Oxygen CSS URI, so the request can be intercepted
- modify CSS based on IDs stored before
- CSS selector modification: `#child_id` => `#parent_id .child_id`
